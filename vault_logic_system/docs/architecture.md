# Architecture

## Overview
The Vault Logic System is a modular framework for decision-making with glyph tracing, memory matrices, and telemetry.

## Components
- **Vaults**: Logic containers
- **Engine**: Execution core
- **Glyphs**: Symbolic tracing
- **Memory**: Persistent storage
- **Telemetry**: Observability

## Flow
Input -> Vaults -> Engine -> Output with traces
